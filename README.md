# embeddings-demo

Welcome to the embeddings demo! All of this is going to be run in a jupyter notebook. If you haven't used those before, you might have to install some stuff to allow you to be able to use it. 

Also, you'll need to get an openai api key. You can figure out how to set that up on their website: https://platform.openai.com/
